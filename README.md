# Virtual-Private-Networks-VPN-
This repository documents my hands-on experience with VPN setup and configuration

## Overview  
This repository documents my experience with VPNs, their functionality, and practical implementation based on the CourseCareers IT lab. It covers VPN configuration, usage, and security principles to ensure encrypted and private network communication.  

## What is a VPN?  
A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** is a secure tunnel that encrypts internet traffic between a user’s device and a remote server. VPNs enhance security, privacy, and remote access capabilities by masking IP addresses and encrypting data transmissions.  

## Key Concepts Covered  
- **Types of VPNs** – Remote Access vs. Site-to-Site VPN  
- **Common VPN Protocols** – OpenVPN, IPSec, WireGuard  
- **Encryption & Authentication** – Ensuring secure communication  
- **VPN Use Cases** – Privacy protection, secure remote access, bypassing geo-restrictions  

## Lab Exercises  

### 1. Setting Up a VPN  
- Installed and configured a VPN server on a virtual machine  
- Set up authentication methods (username/password, certificates)  
- Configured encryption settings for secure communication  

### 2. Connecting a VPN Client  
- Installed a VPN client on a remote device  
- Established a connection to the VPN server  
- Verified IP address change and encrypted data transfer  

### 3. Troubleshooting & Security Measures  
- Diagnosed connection issues using log files  
- Tested VPN security using packet analysis tools (e.g., Wireshark)  
- Implemented firewall rules and access control policies  

## Benefits of Using a VPN  
✔ **Enhanced Privacy** – Hides IP address and encrypts data  
✔ **Secure Remote Access** – Enables safe connections to private networks  
✔ **Protection from Cyber Threats** – Guards against data interception on public Wi-Fi  
✔ **Bypass Geo-Restrictions** – Access region-locked content securely
